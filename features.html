<p1>I built my project off of the code provided by Fahim. I didn't really have to borrow much from the internet.

I have not implemented every single thing that was required for this lab. One of the only thing that does not work is the picking tree functionality. I have implemented the ability to switch between smooth and flat shading. I got my smooth lighting picture verified by the professor on Piazza just to be sure. All the switches work, except for the Gourand/Phong switch. I was writing some code to implement the Phong shading, but couldn't finish it. I managed to implement ambient lighting as an extra feature.
