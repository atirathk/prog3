<p1>I built my project off of the code provided by Fahim. I didn't really have to borrow much from the internet.

I have implemented every single thing that was required for this lab. Translation, rotation, and scaling all work. The requirement for z translation is to press down on the mouse wheel and drag. To see the z translation in action, switch to perspective and or side view. Do not use the Phong or smooth shading switches. I disabled those functionalities for this program. There are no special features.
